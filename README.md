# ImagesofPneumonia-non_Dataset
Pneumonia and non-Pneumonia images classification data sets 
Homework

Intro:

It's time for transfer learning! Training a classifier on medical images is a crucial task to aid doctors and provide lower cost services to patients. If we can build a classifier that can diagnosis a given disease and provide it to patients who can't afford a doctor as an app, we have a scalable business. In this homework, we're going to perform transfer learning to predict pneumonia in a patient, given their chest x-ray data.

Instructions:

Retrain the 'inception v3' image classifier on the pneumonia dataset using Tensorflow+Keras. Create a jupyter notebook of your script and be sure to show the training process as well as 2 examples of it making predictions on images from the testing dataset. This link will give you an idea of how it can be done.
